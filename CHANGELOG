Changes in v1.2 since v1.1:

 * Add a Find function to both My Work and History tabs
 * Add a Cancel button to the progress bar in the status line when
   carrying out network operations
 * Remove Refresh button from the toolbar. This button was found to be
   causing significant confusion, as some users interpreted it as
   meaning resynchronise with the server, while in fact all it did was
   re-read the local working copy. The function is still present, but
   has been relegated to File -> Re-Read Working Folder
 * Rework the filesystem watcher code, making it generally more
   reliable (a requirement for removing the Refresh button)
 * Fix problem with return codes in Mercurial 2.1 causing push and
   pull to be reported as failing
 * Make it possible to clear the remote repository URL
 * Switch the Windows installer from InstallJammer to WiX

Changes in v1.1 since v1.0.1:

 * Closed branches are now supported: you can close a branch in EasyMercurial
   and closed branches are truncated by default
 * Bookmarks are now displayed, though you still cannot create them
 * Fix excessive window size when very long URL or filename used
 * Fix inconsistent state following a merge that results in no changes
 * Improve server port detection when sharing repository
 * Add help topic for merge
 * Update program icon!
