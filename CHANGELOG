Changes in v1.2 since v1.1:

 * Add a Find function to both My Work and History tabs
 * Add a Cancel button to the progress bar in the status line when
   carrying out network operations
 * Remove Refresh button from the toolbar. This button was found to be
   causing significant confusion, as some users interpreted it as

   re-read the local working copy. The function is still present, but
   has been relegated to File -> Re-Read Working Folder

   reliable (a requirement for removing the Refresh button)

   pull to be reported as failing
