<h2>I have a folder of source code or documents on my computer and I want to use version control to manage it</h2>

<p>To start using version control for a project folder, you need to
initialise a repository there.  EasyMercurial does this for you when
you open the folder.</p>

<p><b>1. Click the Open toolbar button or use File -> Open</b></p>

<p><center><img src="images/openfolder50.png"></center></p>

<p><b>2. Select &ldquo;File folder&rdquo; as the thing you want to open</b></p>

<p><b>3. Browse to your folder</b></p>

<p><b>4. Click OK</b></p>

<p>A new repository will be created, stowed into the working folder you
selected.  At first, it will have an empty history.  You can then
start to add and commit changes to your files.</p>

<p>(You will need to &ldquo;add&rdquo; files before you can start to track changes to
them.  The default is for all files in the folder to be treated as
&ldquo;untracked&rdquo;, i.e. not included in the history.)
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is <b>hg init</b></li></ul>
