<h2>I want to let my colleagues pull changes directly from my local repository</h2>

<p>You can do this on a temporary basis using EasyMercurial, for
occasional ad-hoc transfers:</p>

<p><b>1. In EasyMercurial on your computer, go to File -> Share Repository and make a note of the URL shown in the window that is opened</b></p>

<p><b>2. In EasyMercurial on your colleague's computer, either <a href="a-12.html">open a new empty folder</a>, or <a href="a-13.html">reopen a repository</a> that has been pulled from your repository in the past</b></p>

<p><b>3. Go to Remote -> Set Remote Location on your colleague's computer and enter the URL you made a note of in the first step</b></p>

<p><b>4. Click Pull in the main toolbar on your colleague's EasyMercurial program.</b></p>

<p>There are various ways to set this relationship on a less temporary
footing if you have shared access to your local folder, through
network filesystems or via remote login to the computer you are using.
Configuring this is outside the scope of this help document.</p>
