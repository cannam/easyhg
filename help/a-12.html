<h2>I want to start a completely new project using version control</h2>

<p>To start using version control for an initially empty project, just
initialise a repository in an empty folder:</p>

<p><b>1. Click the Open toolbar button or use File -> Open</b></p>

<p><center><img src="images/openfolder50.png"></center></p>

<p><b>2. Select &ldquo;File folder&rdquo; as the thing you want to open</b></p>

<p><b>3. Make a new folder in the file dialog and browse to it</b></p>

<p><b>4. Click OK</b></p>

<p>A new repository will be created, stowed into the empty working folder
you selected.  At first, it will have an empty history.  You can then
start to add and commit changes to your files.
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is <b>hg init</b></li></ul>
