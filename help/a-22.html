<h2>I want to remove, rename, or copy a file</h2>

<p>To remove or rename a file, you first need to find it in the list of
files under &ldquo;My work&rdquo;.  This area normally shows only those files that
you have changed since your last commit: if it isn't one of those,
toggle the &ldquo;Show all files&rdquo; option at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>To <b>remove</b> a file from version control so that changes to it are no longer tracked:</p>

<p><b>1. Select the file you want to remove in the list of files under &ldquo;My work&rdquo;.</b></p>

<p><b>2. Click Remove in the toolbar on the left of the window</b></p>

<p>The file will be moved to the <b>&ldquo;Removed&rdquo;</b> list.  This tells Mercurial
to stop tracking the file the next time you commit.  The file itself
is not removed from the disc: you will need to do that using your
system file manager afterwards.
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is <b>hg remove -Af</b></li></ul></p>

<p>To <b>rename</b> or <b>copy</b> a file:</p>

<p><b>1. Select the file you want to remove in the list of files under &ldquo;My work&rdquo;.</b></p>

<p><b>2. Right-click and select &ldquo;Rename..." or &ldquo;Copy..." on the context menu</b></p>

<p><b>3. Enter a new name for the file.</b>
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial commands are <b>hg rename</b> and <b>hg copy</b></li></ul></p>
