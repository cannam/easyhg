{Making changes}

I just deleted a file using the system file manager -- then remembered I hadn't told the version control tool about it -- what now?

Any files that the version control system thinks should be there, but
that can't be found in your working copy are shown as *"Missing"*
under "My work".  All you need to do is:

*1. Find your file in the "Missing" list and select it*

*2. Click Remove in the toolbar on the left of the window*

This tells Mercurial that you haven't merely lost the file, but that
you intended to remove it.  The next time you commit, it will be
removed from tracking in version control.
