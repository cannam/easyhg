{Making changes}

I've added a new file: what do I do with it?

When you add a new file in the working folder, you normally want to
ensure that Mercurial keeps track of changes to that file -- and that
the file is included in all copies of the repository.  To do this, you
need to tell Mercurial to _track_ the file by adding it to version
control.

EasyMercurial shows files that have been created but not added in the
*"Untracked"* file list under "My Work".  (If your file is not listed
there, try clicking the Refresh button.)

*1. Find the file you want to add in the Untracked list and select it*

*2. Click Add in the toolbar on the left of the window*

The file will be moved to the *"Added"* list.  This tells Mercurial to
track the file.  The next time you commit, the contents of your new
file will be recorded as part of that change set.

 * Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is *hg add*

Of course, you don't always want to track every file in your working
copy.  Object files generated by a compiler, output files from tests,
etc should often not be included in version control.  You can ensure
that such files don't show up in the Untracked list by right-clicking
on them and choosing *"Ignore..."*.
