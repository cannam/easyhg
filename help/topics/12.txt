{Opening and initialising things}

I want to start a new project using version control

You can initialise a repository in an empty folder, in order to start
using version control for a new project:

*1. Click the Open toolbar button or use File -> Open*

#openfolder50

*2. Select "File folder" as the thing you want to open*

*3. Make a new folder in the file dialog and browse to it*

*4. Click OK*

A new repository will be created, stowed into the empty working folder
you selected.  At first, it will have an empty history.  You can then
start to add files and commit changes to your files.

 * Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is *hg init*
