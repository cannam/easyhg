{Opening and initialising things}

I have a Mercurial repository on my local computer already and I want to use it with EasyMercurial

Just open it:

*1. Click the Open toolbar button or use File -> Open*

#openlocal50

*2. Select "Local repository" as the thing you want to open*

*3. Browse to the working folder for your local repository*

*4. Click OK*
