{Sharing changes}

I want to put my changes into a master repository shared with my colleagues

Setting up such a repository with a properly configured remote server
is out of the scope of this Help, but you generally want one of the
following:

*A server that everyone on your team has secure ssh access to*, _or_

*An account with a managed online Mercurial hosting service*

With either of the above, you should be able to create a new
repository on the server and obtain a Mercurial URL for it.  That may
be a _ssh://host/path_ URL in the former case, or the URL (often an
_https_ one) provided by the service in the latter case.

In EasyMercurial, you then:

*1. Go to Remote -> Set Remote Location.., enter the URL of the remote repository and click OK.*

 * This tells EasyMercurial to use that URL as the default location for subsequent push and pull operations.

*2. Click Push on the main toolbar at the top of the EasyMercurial window.*

This will push all of the changes that you have made in your local
repository (since you pushed to the same target, if you ever have).
You should do this regularly whenever you have a coherent set of
changes for others to use or test.  Your colleagues can then pull from
the same remote repository URL to obtain your changes.

For this to work, the target repository must be _related_ to the local
one.  That means either a repository that has been pulled to, or
pushed to from, the local repository before; or the repository that
was initially used to clone the local one from; or else an empty
repository.
