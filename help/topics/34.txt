How do I use the Merge window?

If you are working with other people on a project, it is likely that
at some point you'll find that more than one of you have edited the
same lines in the same file, in different ways.

When that happens and you try to merge the two versions, EasyMercurial
will pop up a merge window that looks a bit like this.

#merge50

(This is actually a separate program, a merge tool called kdiff3.)

This looks a bit complicated, but it is there to help you pick which
of the changes from each of the two "rival" versions of the file you
want to use in your merged version.
