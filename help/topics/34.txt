{Sharing changes}

Every time I push some changes, I have to type my password again

When you push to a remote repository with an "https:" prefix on its
URL, EasyMercurial's password dialog should ask whether you want to
remember your login details.

If you say yes, the details will be stored until EasyMercurial
exits---so you won't have to enter them if you push or pull again
while the present EasyMercurial session is running. Your password will
be stored, encrypted with a session key, in a file which is deleted
when EasyMercurial exits.

*If this option does not appear*

... and if you're using OS/X, then you need to install the PyCrypto
library before EasyMercurial will be able to store encrypted passwords
for you.

Try running @sudo easy_install pycrypto@ in a terminal window.

*Not using an https repository?*

If your remote repository uses ssh or some other protocol, then
EasyMercurial won't be able to help. You might consider using ssh
public key authentication and an ssh agent---talk to the admin of your
remote repository for more details.
