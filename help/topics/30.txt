{Sharing changes}

I have committed some changes -- how do I share them with my colleagues?

There are two common general approaches:

[[31|Permit your colleagues to "pull" your changes]] directly from the local repository in your working folder, _or_

[[32|"Push" your changes to a remote repository]] which you can all use as a master copy.
