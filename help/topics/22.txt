{Making changes}

I want to remove, rename, or copy a file

To remove or rename a file, you first need to find it in the list of
files under "My work".  This area normally shows only those files that
you have changed since your last commit: if it isn't one of those,
toggle the "Show all files" option at the bottom of the window.

To *remove* a file from version control so that changes to it are no longer tracked:

*1. Select the file you want to remove in the list of files under "My work".*

*2. Click Remove in the toolbar on the left of the window*

The file will be moved to the *"Removed"* list.  This tells Mercurial
to stop tracking the file the next time you commit.  The file itself
is not removed from the disc: you will need to do that using your
system file manager afterwards.

 * Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is *hg remove -Af*

To *rename* or *copy* a file:

*1. Select the file you want to remove in the list of files under "My work".*

*2. Right-click and select "Rename..." or "Copy..." on the context menu*

*3. Enter a new name for the file.*

 * Note: the equivalent Mercurial commands are *hg rename* and *hg copy*
