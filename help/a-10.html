<h2>Someone gave me a repository URL and asked me to clone it</h2>

<p>A Mercurial repository location is usually described by a URL, like
that of a website.</p>

<p>For example, the URL for the repository containing the source code for
EasyMercurial itself is <code>https://bitbucket.org/cannam/easyhg</code>.</p>

<p>To get a copy of the files in a repository, you need to <i>clone</i> the
repository from the remote URL into a folder on your own computer.  To
do this,</p>

<p><b>1. click the Open toolbar button or use File -> Open</b></p>

<p><center><img src="images/openremote50.png"></center></p>

<p><b>2. select &ldquo;Remote Repository&rdquo; as the thing you want to open</b></p>

<p><b>3. enter the repository URL into the URL field</b></p>

<p><b>4. give the name of a folder on your local computer to clone into</b> &ndash;
 this folder will be created for you, so it shouldn't be one that already
 exists</p>

<p><b>5. click OK</b></p>

<p>If the remote repository has restricted access, you may be asked to
provide a username and password to log in to the server it is hosted
on.  If the repository is large, you may have to wait a while for all the
data to be transferred.</p>

<p>Provided the clone has been successful, you should now have a local
repository to work in.</p>
