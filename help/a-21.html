<h2>I have changed some files and I want to record the changes</h2>

<p>Click the Commit button in the toolbar on the left to commit all of
the changes you have made to tracked files in your working folder.
That is, all files listed as <b>&ldquo;Modified&rdquo;</b>, <b>&ldquo;Removed&rdquo;</b>, or <b>&ldquo;Added&rdquo;</b>
under &ldquo;My Work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(If the files you have changed are still listed as <b>&ldquo;Untracked&rdquo;</b>, then
you must add them before you can commit.  See <a href="a-20.html">I've added a new file...</a>.</p>

<p>When you commit your changes, you will be asked for a commit message
which will accompany that change set in the history.  Enter something
that will help you remember &ndash; and other readers understand &ndash; what
you have changed and why.</p>

<p>If you want to commit only some files, right-click on them in the list
and choose Commit from the context menu.
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is <b>hg commit</b></li></ul></p>
