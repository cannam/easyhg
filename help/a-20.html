<h2>I've added a new file: what do I do with it?</h2>

<p>When you add a new file in the working folder, you normally want to
ensure that Mercurial keeps track of changes to that file &ndash; and that
the file is included in all copies of the repository.  To do this, you
need to tell Mercurial to <i>track</i> the file by adding it to version
control.</p>

<p>EasyMercurial shows files that have been created but not added in the
<b>&ldquo;Untracked&rdquo;</b> file list under &ldquo;My work&rdquo;.  (If your file is not listed
there, try clicking the Refresh button.)</p>

<p><b>1. Find the file you want to add in the Untracked list and select it</b></p>

<p><b>2. Click Add in the toolbar on the left of the window</b></p>

<p>The file will be moved to the <b>&ldquo;Added&rdquo;</b> list.  This tells Mercurial to
track the file.  The next time you commit, the contents of your new
file will be recorded as part of that change set.
<ul><li>Note: the equivalent Mercurial command for this is <b>hg add</b></li></ul></p>

<p>Of course, you don't always want to track every file in your working
copy.  Object files generated by a compiler, output files from tests,
etc should often not be included in version control.  You can ensure
that such files don't show up in the Untracked list by right-clicking
on them and choosing <b>&ldquo;Ignore..."</b>.</p>
