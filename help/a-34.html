<h2>Every time I push some changes, I have to type my password again</h2>

<p>When you push to a remote repository with an &ldquo;https:" prefix on its
URL, EasyMercurial's password dialog should ask whether you want to
remember your login details.</p>

<p>If you say yes, the details will be stored until EasyMercurial
exits&mdash;so you won't have to enter them if you push or pull again
while the present EasyMercurial session is running. Your password will
be stored, encrypted with a session key, in a file which is deleted
when EasyMercurial exits.</p>

<p><b>If this option does not appear</b></p>

<p>... and if you're using OS/X, then you need to install the PyCrypto
library before EasyMercurial will be able to store encrypted passwords
for you.</p>

<p>Try running <code>sudo easy_install pycrypto</code> in a terminal window.</p>

<p><b>Not using an https repository?</b></p>

<p>If your remote repository uses ssh or some other protocol, then
EasyMercurial won't be able to help. You might consider using ssh
public key authentication and an ssh agent&mdash;talk to the admin of your
remote repository for more details.</p>
