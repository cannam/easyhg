<h2>I have committed some changes &ndash; how do I share them with my colleagues?</h2>

<p>There are two common general approaches:</p>

<p><a href="a-31.html">Permit your colleagues to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; your changes</a> directly from the local repository in your working folder, <i>or</i></p>

<p><a href="a-32.html">&ldquo;Push&rdquo; your changes to a shared remote repository</a> which you can all use as a master copy.</p>
